# image_classifier
Machine Learning Image Classifier using a dataset called “cifar10”, which is mainly used for training purposes.

The classes of this classifier are the defaults of cifar10 which are: ‘Plane’, ‘Car’, ‘Bird’, ‘Cat’, ‘Deer’, ‘Dog’, ‘Frog’, ‘Horse’, ‘Ship’ and ‘Truck’.

This project is purely a demo, a simple Image Classifier with no real applications. It’s only purpose is to show to the reader that I am fully able to create any kind of Classifier for business applications, such as digit classifier, or client classifier and many more for any purposes.

In order to highlight the usefulness of Machine Learning Image Classifiers in business applications, I want to give a simple example. 
Imagine that there are countless pages in a clientele, and for some reason there is a need that this clientele must be classified into two or more categories. Using a trained AI Image Classifier, one can separate clients who spend more than a specific value from those which spend less.
A human employee could take a week to classify all those pages and often make mistakes due to the nature of this monotonous work. A well trained AI on the other hand, could finish in some minutes and with a controlled-mistake-frequency, in some cases with almost no mistakes at all!

The “Image_Classifier.model” folder contains the trained model.

The “Images_for_Classification” folder contains the images for classification.

The “imageclassifier.py” file is the python code of this classifier.

The “ml-metrics.pdf” file is the metrics of machine learning training, which shows info of the accuracy and loss cycles of epochs. The validation accuracy caps around 72% in the first 100 epochs, as well as remains almost stable at around 70 percent from 7 to 100 epochs.
